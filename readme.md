# Skill Bridge Virtual Careers - Appointment Booking System

## Overview

Skill Bridge Virtual Careers is a digital marketing agency founded by Retchellie Casera in October 2022 and officially launched in January 2023. Operating from Malasiqui, Pangasinan, Philippines, the agency offers a comprehensive range of virtual assistance and marketing services, including administrative support, customer service, social media management, and content marketing.

To address inefficiencies in the manual appointment scheduling process, the agency developed the Skill Bridge Appointment Booking System. This system streamlines scheduling, reduces administrative burdens, and enhances operational efficiency, allowing the agency to manage client appointments more effectively.
